# SPACES
SPACES is a vector drawing software with a focus on keeping a constant distance between all shapes.
No colors, layers, gradients and effects here : only straight strokes shapes. Once happy with the geometry, just export to svg and continue with a more generic vector software.

With each shape created, two guides are automatically added for each stroke : one along it and an other parallel, spaced by a constant distance. These guides will help you create other shapes alongside the others while keeping that distance constraint.

This demo page is a static version : a backend integration to save the drawings online is in progress.

SPACES is powered by Vue.Js
Icons are made with Inkscape and compressed with https://vecta.io/nano
Core functions tested with Jest and the help of https://www.geogebra.org/classic
